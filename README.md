### Developer Notes

**To run locally:** tested with Ruby 3.1.3 and jekyll 4.3.3. You might have to do `bundle install` or `bundle update` before serving the website locally.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

**To pass GitHub actions:** if you change the `Gemfile`, you need to `bundle update` to get the addtional gems installed. This changes the `Gemfile.lock` file. If you commit the lock file, you need to add the linux platform to it so GitHub actions work and the website is deployed without error:

```
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
```

**To get relative links:** I had to add the `jekyll-relative-links` gem to the Gemfile (this should be distributed with GitHub pages, but it didn't work with just-the-docs template).
