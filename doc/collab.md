# Collaboration Policy

Computational biology is inherently a collaborative field, and there are many opportunities to work with and get help from different people within and outside of class. As an interdisciplinary course, doing work in Bio131 may lead to a few questions.  Who can you talk to? What resources can you use?  What does it mean to "cheat" while writing a program? This page describes available resources and what actions are in violation of the Honor Principle. Also see the [course support page](support.md).

1. You can ask **anyone** (Anna, tutors, other students) **anything** during lectures and labs.
2. You can **always** come to posted student hours or DoJo tutoring hours.
3. You can **always** look up how to use specific data types, syntax, and built-in functions we have learned in Python.

## Collaborations on assignments and exams

**Exams** will have an in-class, collaborative component and a take-home, individual component. You can work with other students on the in-class component, but you should do the take-home component on your own. Follow the instructions provided with the exam about what resources you can use during the exam.

Working together is encouraged for the **programming assignments.** You can talk to other students about the homework as much as you like, but you must write your own programs (even if you do it side-by-side). You need to "cite" who you work with - see below for more information.

You are encouraged to talk with others about the **book assignment**; the reflections should be your own writing.

## Plagiarism when programming

Code plagiarism is a real thing.  Just like when writing papers, there is a way to cite others' work.  Identical code is just as bad as copying and pasting entire paragraphs of an essay from another source - **always write your code in your own style.**  You have a lot of flexibility in naming variables, including print statements and comments in your code.

1. The early programming assignments may have instructions to copy code exactly; in these examples, many students will have identical code, which is fine.  If you are uncertain about a homework, ask me.
2. For the larger programming assignments, your code may look similar to others if you work side by side.  If you have extensive discussions with me, tutors, or students, add their names as comments to the header of the file. For example,

```
 # Anna helped me begin problem 2
 # I discussed how to speed up problem 4 with Alex
 # I helped Jane out with problem 5.
```

Remember, this type of collaboration is expected and encouraged! People who worked together should list each other as collaborators, this will help us determine why some code might look similar.
