### Grading Contract

According to the [Reed College Guidebook](https://www.reed.edu/guidebook/acad_pol/eval_student.html), a grade of an A denotes excellent work, a grade of B denotes above average work, a grade of C denotes average work, a grade of D denotes minimal but passing amount of work, and a grade of F denotes not a passing amount of work.

The eight common assignments (exams E1-E2, programming assignments P1-P4, and book reflections B1-B2) and the four required in-class components (completing the two conference meetings, attending the final exam slot, and completing 6 of 8 programming labs) are designed so that if students complete them, they will earn a B. If you earn a B in the course, you will have learned _a lot_ about computational biology. You are expected to submit the work you have done by each deadline (you will be able to resubmit the work - see the [deadline policy](../policies.md#deadline-policy). **All work for the course must becompleted by the last day of finals (Thursady, May 9th) at 5pm.**

Note that, according to the [schedule](../schedule.md), the common assignments will be completed by the beginning of Week 12. For the last two weeks, students can choose to revisit the common assignments they wish to improve upon or complete one or more of the choose-your-own (CYO) assignments. The CYO assignments for each theme are listed in the [types of work page](components.md).

## Grading Contract Table

The table below is based off of requirements for a B. To earn higher than a B, you will complete additional CYO assignments. If you partially complete assignments, miss assignments, or miss in-class components, that reduces your grade. The number of missed assignments and in-class components are considered first. For example:
- If you miss one assignment, you will earn no higher than a C- (even if all other work is complete). 
- If you miss one of the in-class components, you will earn no higher than a B- (even if all other work is complete).
- Suppose you partially complete an exam and a programming assignment, complete the remaining assignments, and miss 2 in-class components. Missing the 2 in-class components means you will earn a C, even though the two partially complete assignments are in different themes.
- Suppose you partially complete 3 assignments, but have no missing assignments or missing in-class components. You will earn a C-, even though you're not missing work. 

Remember, you will have time near the end of the semester to revisit any assignments (including the conferences and the labs).

| Earned Grade | Requirements | #  Missed Assignments Allowed (8 total) | # Missed In-Class Components Allowed (4 total) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| A | Requirements for a B and at least one CYO assignment in each theme (3 total) | 0 | 0 |
| A- | Requirements for a B and at least two CYO assignments | 0 | 0 |
| B+ | Requirements for a B and one CYO assignment | 0 | 0 |
| **B** | **Complete eight common assignments (exams E1-E2, programming assignments P1-P4, and book reflections B1-B2) and the four in-class components (two conference meetings, attending the final exam slot, and completing 6 of 8 programming labs)** | **0** | **0** |
| B- | Requirements for a B, except 1 assignment is partially completed | 0 | 1 |
| C+ | Requirements for a B, except 2 assignments in different themes are partially completed | 0 | 1 |
| C | Requirements for a B, except 2 assignments in the same theme are partially completed | 0 | 2 |
| C- | Requirements for a B, except up to 3 assignments are partially completed | 1 | 2 |
| D | Requirements for a B, except up to 4 assignments are partially completed | 2 | 3 |
| F | Requirements for a D are not met | >2 | >3 |

You will communicate your course plans at multiple points throughout the semester.

- Starter Assignment: in the first week, you will share your reasons for taking the course, what success in the course means to you, and your plans for achieving that success.
- Conferences: In weeks 7 and 12, you will meet with me one-on-one during the lab slot to reflect on your course goals and talk about any of the themes / assignments in the class. In Week 7, we will negotiate your mid-term grade. In week 12, we will negotiate your final grade based on your planned CYO assignments.
- You are welcome to talk with me any time about your progress in the course and how it aligns with your goals. Communication is key.

## Illness and Exceptional Circumstances

_This also appears on the [support page](../support.md)_

There may be cases where you cannot attend class for stretches at a time (due to illness, for example). In this case, email me to strategize a successful plan for learning the material. If you miss multiple classes and do not email me, I may reach out to make sure you are OK. 

In rare cases, there may be circumstances beyond your control where you are unable to meet the expectations outlined in this syllabus. If there are extenuating circumstances that might impact your academic performance in this class, please inform me as soon as you can to strategize a plan for completing all parts of the course. Additionally, you may want to reach out to the [Student Life Office](https://www.reed.edu/student-life/) at student-life@reed.edu, phone: (503) 517-7396, office: Eliot 218. The Student Life Office is dedicated to assisting students in accessing campus and support resources, especially during challenging situations.
