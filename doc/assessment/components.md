# Types of Work

There are three types of work that will be done outside of class: work on **biology and computational thinking concepts**, work on **programming skills**, and work on **biology and society**. In addition to these three themes, there is also some in-class work that will count towards your grade. All work will be assessed as "complete," "partially complete," or "missing" according to the criteria below. 

Each section also includes a number of choose-your-own (CYO) assignments. You will have time to complete one or more of the CYO assignments near the end of the semester; they are explained in more detail in the [grading contract](gradingcontract.md).

## 1. Biology and Computational Thinking

In Bio131, you will learn about biological sequences (DNA, RNA, and protein), the relationships among these molecules, and some biological questions that researchers study. You will also learn how to take these biological questions and turn them into a form that can we can solve with computation.

The work for this theme consists of two exams (E1 and E2), which each have a collaborative in-class component and an individual take-home component. The exam questions are multi-part questions, and there are usually 2 questions for the in-class component and 5-7 questions on the take-home component (depending on the amount of content the exam covers). 

The purpose of the in-class component is to practice answering exam questions, either on your own or with other students.  Working with other students in class is also a way for you to learn about how others approach the exam quetsions. The in-class exam questions will not be evaluated on whether they are correct, since they are practice. 

The purpose of the take-home component is to demonstrate your knowledge about the concepts from lectures, so the take-home component must be done individually. To pass a question on the take-home component, you will have to follow all directions and get the majority of the question correct. The criteria for success will be clearly described for each question on take-home component the exam. You will have the opportunity to revise the questions after receiving feedback.

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| In-Class Component | You submit answers to the questions | N/A | You do not submit answers to the questions |
| Take-Home Component | You pass all questions | You pass at least 60% of the questions| You pass fewer than 60% of the questions or you do not submit the exam |
| **Exam Total** | Both components are complete | The take-home component is partially complete and the in-class component is complete | One or both of the components are missing |

### CYO Assignments

- Pass additional take-home questions on the biology topics presented in weeks 11 & 12.
- Read an additional chapter of the textbook and describe the biological question, why it's important, and how people have solved it as a computational question (750 words).
- Write your own exam questions (& solutions) on the course content. You can be as creative as you want here.

## 2. Programming Skills

Bio131 is designed to introduce Python programming as a way to implement solutions to computational problems. There is no expectation of programming knowledge prior to this course - everything you need will be taught and practiced in lectures and labs. We also have lots of built-in support for the class - see the [support page](../support.md) for some resources.

The work for this theme consists of four programming assignments (P1-P4), some of which are multi-week assignments. The purpose of these assignments is to demonstrate your knowledge of Python programming and your understanding of how biological questions can be posed and answered using computers. Collaboration is highly encouraged for this type of outside work - refer to the [collaboration policy](../policies.md#collaboration-policy) for more information.

Each programming assignment has multiple tests that check the outputs of your programs - these are called _unit tests_ and they are automatically run when you submit your assignment in GitHub Classroom. The criteria for success corresponds to how many tests your code passes. You can resubmit any of the programming assignments at any time, including after getting feedback. It is extremely important that your code runs without errors - note that if your code does not run because of one or more errors it does not pass any tests and will be considered Missing. 

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **P1: Python Practice** | 9 or more out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 3-8 tests pass | Fewer than 3 tests pass or you do not submit the assignment |
| **P2: Central Dogma** | 8 or more out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 3-7 tests pass | Fewer than 3 tests pass or you do not submit the assignment |
| **P3: Motif Finding** | 8 or more out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 3-7 tests pass | Fewer than 3 tests pass or you do not submit the assignment |
| **P4: Alignment** | 8 or more out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 3-7 tests pass | Fewer than 3 tests pass or you do not submit the assignment |

_Note_: The number of tests are approximate, and will be updated when the assignments are finalized.

### CYO Assignments

- Implement additional lab-like assignments to visualize skew, visualize genome assemblies, and visualize dot plots
- Implement an assignment to assemble a (very small) genome
- Implement an extension of P3 (motif finding) to use Gibbs sampling
- Implement an extension of P4 for local alignment or affine gap alignment
- Implement another problem in the textbook (talk with Anna)

## 3. Biology and Society

New this year, we will read about and discuss aspects of genetic testing and its influence on society and culture (and vice versa). You will choose one of two books to focus on throughout the semester.

The work for this theme consists of two written reflections (B1 and B2) followed by two discussions during lab. The purpose of the written reflection is to take some time to think about the book and prepare for the in-lab discussion. Therefore, if you submit the written reflection after the in-lab discussion, it will be marked as "Partially Complete." The purpose of the in-lab discussion is to share your thoughts with other students and also hear a bit about the _other_ book you did not choose. If you cannot make the lab, you can submit an additional reflection for a "Complete" mark.

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Written Reflection | You write 250 or more words in response to the writing prompt | You write fewer than 250 words in response to the writing prompt or you submit the assignment after the in-lab discussion | You do not submit the assignment |
| Discussion | You attend lab and discuss the in-lab prompt, or you cannot attend lab and you write an additional 750 words on the in-lab prompt | N/A | You do not attend the lab and you do not submit the additional reflection |
| **Book Assignment Total** | The reflection and the discussion are complete | The reflection is partially complete and the discussion is complete | One or both of the reflection and the discussion are missing | 

### CYO Assignments

- Read the entire book and write a letter to an interested person (real or imaginary) about what you liked about the book, what challenged you about the book, and why the topic is important (750 words).
- Read an excerpt from the other book (the one you did not choose) and imagine the two authors in conversation. What would they say to each other? Where would they agree and where would they disagree? (750 words).
- Write an essay about how computation is used to determine ancestry, and the use of computational biology / bioinformatics in the books (750 words).
- Share what you learned in some creative way (talk with Anna)

## 4. In-Class Components

In addition to the three themes of outside work, labor is also done in class. There are four additional pieces of work (which are marked either "completed" or "missing").

- There are two conferences which are lab sections reserved for scheduling one-on-one meetings with me. We will take this time to reflect on your course goals and talk about any of the themes / assignments in the class. These must be completed (in the sense that you have two one-on-one meetings with me; if you cannot meet during the scheduled time we will reschedule).
- During finals week, there will be a finals slot reserved for short presentations from your colleagues. You are required to attend this finals slot (and you can choose to present something - see the CYO assignment below).
- You must complete six of the eight programming labs (L1-L8). Programming labs are an opportunity to work on shorter pieces of code that help you prepare for the programming assignments. The purpose of these labs are to prepare you for the programming assignments and give you additional insight into the lecture content. In many cases, the labs are components of the programming assignments. Lab time is also a place where the TA and I will be available to help with any programming issues you face. Note that you can submit labs that are not complete - the goal here is that you have spent an hour or so working through the material. 

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Conference (x2) | You meet with me one-on-one | N/A | You don't meet with me one-on-one |
| Finals Slot | You attend the finals slot | N/A | You don't attend the finals slot |
| Programming Labs | You submit 6 of the 8 programming labs (which are either complete or you worked each one for at least an hour) | N/A | You submit 5 or fewer programming labs |

#### CYO Assignment

Share something you learned in a short (10-15 minutes) presentation during the finals week slot. You can talk about anything pertaining to class, in any way you would like (as long as it fills the expected presentation length). You will meet with me to discuss your plan to make sure this CYO assignment has the appropriate scope. Note that all students are expected to attend the presentations, but only students who decided to do this CYO assignment will present.
