## Assessment Components

Refer to the [schedule overview](schedule.md) and find all details on the Moodle page. Any changes to this page (and other pages) will be documented in the [change log](changelog.md)

There are three types of work that will be done outside of class: work on **biology and computational thinking concepts**, work on **programming skills**, and work on **biology and society**. All the work will be assessed as "complete," "partially complete," or "missing." Additionally, each theme below includes a number of choose-your-own (CYO) assignments. These are explained in the [final breakdown page](finalbreakdown.md).

For more information about the specific learning objectives, see the [goals page](goals.md).

### 1. Biology and Computational Thinking

In Bio131, you will learn about biological sequences (DNA, RNA, and protein), the relationships among these molecules, and some biological questions that researchers study. You will also learn how to take these biological questions and turn them into a form that can we can solve with computation.

The work for this theme consists of two exams (E1 and E2), which each have a collaborative (in-class) component and an individual (take-home) component.

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Collaborative Component | You attend the class and work with others on the questions, or you cannot attend class but you complete the questions | N/A | You do not attend class and you do not complete the questions |
| Individual Component | You follow all instructions and pass each question | You follow all instructions and pass some (but not all) questions | You do not follow instructions or you do not submit the exam |

_Notes_:

- The collaborative component does not need to be correct (just completed); this is for you to practice answering exam questions.
- You will be able to resubmit the individual components of the exams after getting feedback on partially complete exams.
- There are usually 5-7 multi-part questions (depending on the amount of content that the exam covers); to pass a question you will have to get the majority of the question correct. The criteria for success will be clearly described for each question on the exam.

#### CYO Assignments

- Write your own exam questions (& solutions) on the course content.
- Complete additional take-Home questions on the biology topics presented in weeks 11 & 12.
- Read an additional chapter of the textbook and write a summary about the biological and computational problems.

### 2. Programming Skills

Bio131 is also designed to introduce Python programming as a way to implement solutions to computational problems. There is no expectation of programming knowledge prior to this course - everything you need will be taught and practiced in lectures and labs. We also have lots of built-in support for the class - see the [support page](support.md) for some resources.

The work for this theme consists of four programming assignments (P1,P2,P3, and P4), some of which are multi-week assignments. Each programming assignment has multiple tests that check the outputs of your programs - these are called _unit tests_ and they are automatically run when you submit your assignment in GitHub Classroom. The criteria for success corresponds to how many tests your code passes. Additionally, it is extremely important that your code runs without errors. Therefore, if it does not run because of one or more errors it is considered Missing.

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| P1: Python Practice | 10 out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 1-9 tests pass | The code does not run or the assignment was not submitted |
| P2: Central Dogma | >8 out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 1-7 tests pass | The code does not run or the assignment was not submitted |
| P3: Motif Finding | >8 out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 1-7 tests pass | The code does not run or the assignment was not submitted |
| P4: Alignment | >8 out of 10 tests pass | The code runs and 1-7 tests pass | The code does not run or the assignment was not submitted |

_Notes_:

- The number of tests are approximate, and will be updated when the assignments are finalized.
- You will be able to resubmit any of the programming assignments after getting feedback on partially complete assignments or assignments that do not run.
- Documenting your code is also important - you will get feedback on this, though it is not part of the criteria for success.

#### CYO Assignments

- Implement two additional visualization labs (visualizing skew and visualizing dot plots)
- Implement an assignment to visualize and generate genome assembly
- Implement an extension of P3 (motif finding) to use Gibbs sampling
- Implement an extension of P4 for local alignment or affine gap alignment
- Implement another problem in the textbook (talk with Anna)

### 3. Biology and Society

New this year, we will read about and discuss aspects of genetic testing and its influence on society and culture (and vice versa). You will choose one of two books to focus on throughout the semester.

The work for this theme consists of two written reflections (B1 and B2) followed by two discussions during lab.

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Written Reflection | You write 250 or more words in response to the writing prompt | You write <250 words in response to the writing prompt | The assignment was not submitted |
| Discussion | You attend the class and discuss the in-lab prompt, or you cannot attend class but you write an additional 500 words on the in-lab prompt | N/A | You do not attend class and you do not submit the additional reflection |

#### CYO Assignments

- Read the entire book and provide a reflection or summary (750 words) on an aspect of the book we did not discuss in class.
- Read an excerpt from the you did not choose and write a comparison (750 words) of the two readings.
- Write an essay (750 words) about how computation is used to determine ancestry, and the use of computational biology / bioinformatics in the books.
- Share what you learned in some creative way (talk with Anna)

### In-Class Components

In addition to the three themes of outside work, labor is also done in class as well.

- There are two conferences (C1 & C2), where you will schedule one-on-one meetings with me during your lab section. We will take this time to reflect on your course goals and contract and talk about any of the themes / assignments in the class. These must be completed (in the sense that you have two one-on-one meetings with me; if you cannot meet during the scheduled time we will reschedule).
- There are eight programming labs (L1-L8), where you will work on shorter pieces of code that help you prepare for the programming assignments. In some cases you will get the lab solution at the end of lab to help you with outside work. While there is no hard requirement that you complete the lab during your lab section, I strongly encourage you to make use of the TA and my help during these time slots.

| | Complete | Partially Complete | Missing |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Programming Lab | You submit the programming lab. | N/A | The lab was not submitted |

You must complete 7 of the 8 programming labs, but note that if you do not submit a lab, you might have to do that work as part of a programming assignment outside of class.

- During finals week, there will be a finals slot reserved for short presentations from your colleagues. You are required to attend this finals slot.

#### CYO Assignment

- Share something you learned in a short presentation during the finals week slot. This can be on any of the above themes, and it can be on the common work or on the CYO assignments. Note that all students are expected to attend the presentations, but you can choose whether you want to share something you learned.
