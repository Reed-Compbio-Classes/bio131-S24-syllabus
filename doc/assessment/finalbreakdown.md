## Grading Contract

According to the [Reed College Guidebook](https://www.reed.edu/guidebook/acad_pol/eval_student.html), a grade of an A denotes excellent work, a grade of B denotes above average work, a grade of C denotes average work, a grade of D denotes minimal but passing amount of work, and a grade of F denotes not a passing amount of work.

The eight common assignments (exams E1-E2, programming assignments P1-P4, and book reflections B1-B2) are designed so that if students complete them (and no other choose-your-own assignments), they will earn a B. If you earn a B in the course, you will have learned _a lot_ about computational biology. Note that if you miss any of the eight assignments, you will earn no higher than a C-.

| Earned Grade | Requirements | # Missed Assignments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Requirements for a B and at least one CYO assignment in each theme (3 total) | |
| A- | Requirements for a B and at least two CYO assignments | 0 |
| B+ | Requirements for a B and one CYO assignment | 0 |
| **B** | **Complete all 8 assignments** | **0** |
| B- | Complete 7 of 8 assignments, partially complete one assignment | 0 |
| C+ | Complete 6 of 8 assignments, partially complete two assignments in different themes | 0 |
| C | Complete 6 of 8 assignments, partially complete two assignments in same theme | 0 |
| C- | Complete 6 of 8 assignments, partially complete 1-2 assignments | 1 |
| D | Complete 5 of 8 assignments, partially complete 1-3 assignments| 2 |
| F | Do not complete 5 assignments | >3 |

You will communicate your course plans at multiple points throughout the semester.

- Grading Contract Assignment: in the first week, you will share your reasons for taking the course, what success in the course means to you, and your plans for achieving that success.
- Conferences: In weeks 7 and 12, you will meet with me one-on-one during the lab slot to reflect on your course goals and talk about any of the themes / assignments in the class. In Week 7, we will negotiate your mid-term grade (which will be an "S" for satisfactory work). In week 12, we will negotiate your final grade based on your planned choose-your-own assignments.
- Final Portfolio: During finals week, you will submit a document that reflects on the course learning objectives, your personal goals, and points to specific assignments that illustrate your learning gains in the three general themes of the course (biology & computational thinking, programming skills, and biology & society). More information about the final portfolio is found on the [next page](portfolio.md).


## Petition for Exceptional Circumstances

This grading scheme is a public contract for the entire class, so my job is to make sure that any exceptions to this contract are administered fairly. In rare cases, there may be circumstances beyond your control where you are unable to meet the contract. You must meet with me as soon as possible to make a fair and equitable arrangement (preferably before you breach the contract). You may petition for any reason, but only once over the course of the semester.
