## Overview of Contract Grading

Bio131 is based on _labor based grading_, which has been extensively described and used by Asao B. Inoue at Arizona State University. For more information about labor based grading for writing classes, refer to his [webpage of labor based grading resources](https://tinyurl.com/LaborBasedGrading). In the Spring 2024 iteration of Bio131, we are going to use aspects of labor based grading and contract negotiations (adapted from Asao B. Inoue's 2023 template).

**Keep in Mind:** Since this is the first time we're doing labor based contract grading in Bio131, there might be some bumps in the road. Please be flexible and communicate any issues you see as we go.

### Purpose

Grades have been purported to be an unbiased way to evaluate students in a course - faculty use them to motivate student learning, compare student performance, and gain an overall assessment of student learning. In fact many studies have found that grades have the exact opposite effect - they can lessen a student's motivation to learn, they can create a competitive classroom environment, and they have been shown to be inconsistent (for example, when different people grade the same work or when the same person evaluates the same work at different times) ([Schinske and Tanner 2017](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.cbe-14-03-0054)). Grades negatively affect students in at least three ways: (a) they diminish students' interest in what they're learning, they (b) create a preference for the easiest possible task, and (c) they reduce the quality of students' thinking ([Kohn 2011](http://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/)). Additionally, grades have an underlying assumption that every student is the same -- in their preparation, in their learning styles, and in their reasons for taking the class ([Robinson 2020 TED Talk](https://youtu.be/zDZFcDGpL4U)). **In short, grades do not help students learn and grades do not value the differences that students bring to the classroom.**

For the time being, though, we're stuck with grades. While Reed's policy of an "S" denotes satisfactory work, you all earn a grade in each one of your classes (whether you see it or not). Labor based contract grading aims to reward the process and practice of learning, encourage risk-taking, and give students agency to learn concepts that they are the most interested in. The goal is to shift the power of the grade from the instructor (with the instructor's values) to the students.

Contract grading clearly outlines the criteria for success in the course, and students can choose what success means to them (in terms of the letter grade). The "labor based" part of the grading emphasizes the _time_ you put into the work, rather than the _quality_ of the work you do. I will still be giving you lots of feedback throughout the course, but this feedback is designed to be independent of your completion of the work (with some exceptions). You will know your grade at each step of the course, because you will negotiate the grade with me at the 8-week mark and through the final portfolio assignment. This negotiation gives you the space to explain how you have completed the learning objectives through your labor in the class.
