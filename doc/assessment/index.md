# Course Structure & Assessment

There are three main components of Bio131, which are assessed using a grading contract. The purpose of this structure and the grading scheme is to give students a chance to explore the biology, computational methods, and how these ideas might affect or reflect societal values. Spring 2024 is the first time Bio131 has this structure and assessment type, so we will adjust pieces as necessary.

## Communication & Technology

**Official communications about all course materials and assignments will be done through the Moodle page. The course content may be adjusted - check your email every day to stay updated. Additionally,
- We will use GitHub Classroom and GitHub Codespaces for the programming assignments (you will be taught how to use it)
- There will be a Google Calendar with deadlines, if you would like to add it to your calendaring system.
- Students can find optional challenge problems on [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/), which has a [textbook track](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track) that follows the class textbook. Come talk to me if you would like to explore this resource and I can help you get started.
