# Generative AI Policy

Generative AI is technology that is trained to generate text, images, or code from natural language prompts.  Two examples of generative AI that you might have seen before are ChatGPT (which returns text based on prompts) and GitHub Copilot (which returns code based on prompts).

The fact is, generative AI could do a pretty darn good job with some of the programming assignments. But the assignments are designed for _you_ to learn how to program in Python, and how to apply those skills to biological questions. Some of the things that are easy for generative AI to do -- for example, write some starter code for an assignment -- are extremely useful exercises for people who are learning to program. The course goals of this class include learning how to implement computational biology solutions - if you use generative AI to do that, you aren't learning how to implement it on your own. 

The same goes for using generative AI for solving exam questions. Generative AI might get some questions correct, but _you_ would not be demonstrating that you have learned the content. But don't worry - you will have opportunities to revise exams in order to demonstrate your learning.

Finally, generative AI will not do much good writing reflections based on the books, since the goal of the reflections is not necessarily the quality of the writing but a preparation for the in-lab discussion with your colleagues.

The goal of this class is to never make you feel like you just have to get the answer, no matter where it comes from. If you are feeling like this, then come talk with me and/or the tutors and we will strategize a way to help you learn the content without that pressure.

## Generative AI should not be used in this class. But you should never feel the need to use it anyway.
