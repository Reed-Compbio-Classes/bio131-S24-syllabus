# Generative AI (ChatGPT) Policy

Okay, so here's the deal. ChatGPT could do a pretty darn good job with some of the programming assignments. But the assignments are designed for _you_ to learn how to program in Python, and how to apply those skills to biological questions. The goal of this class is to never make you feel like you just have to get the answer, no matter where it comes from. If you are feeling like this, then come talk with me and/or the tutors and we will strategize a way to help you learn the content without that pressure.

Generative AI might help you with one or two of the exam questions, but it will likely take more time to enter in the question and the context than answering the question in the first place. You will also have opportunities to revise exams if you need it.

Finally, generative AI will not do much good writing reflections based on the books, since the goals of those reflections is not necessarily the quality of the writing but a preparation for the in-lab discussion with your colleagues.

## Generative AI should not be used in this class. But you should never feel the need to use it anyway.
