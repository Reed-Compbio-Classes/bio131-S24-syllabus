# Learning Environment

Bio131 is a combination of biology and computer science, and each field has been claimed to be free of racism and prejudice.  This is simply not true.  Historically, biological discoveries and advances in computer science have been dominated by privileged voices, namely those of white men.  Computational biology, while more recent of a field, also lacks diversity along many important axes (including race, gender, nationality, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.).  To foster an inclusive learning environment:

1. I (Anna Ritz) acknowledge the bias in course materials that stem from systemic privilege, and I aim to make Bio131 content more inclusive each time I teach the course.
2. This course is designed for students with no programming experience, but you may come to Bio131 with varying levels of preparation in both biology and computer science. It is important to remember that this is an introductory course, and my priority is to teach from the ground up.  Use the [collaboration policy](collab.md) as a way to work with others and help them get comfortable with programming concepts.
3. I will highlight virtual seminars and events hosted by computational biology groups such as the [Black Women in Computational Biology Network](https://www.blackwomencompbio.org/).
4. Many students will have personal circumstances that may affect their performance in the course.  I will work with you to make adjustments to the course schedule as needed, and students should be encouraged to seek guidance on any anticipated or realized issues.
5. Mental and physical health is more important than attending all parts of class.  If you miss multiple days of class, I will reach out to make sure you are okay.

Bio131 is a better course when students have a diversity of lived experience and previous knowledge.

## Additional Community Rules for Spring 2024

TBD

## Feedback for the Instructor
Please give me feedback on anything in the syllabus or course, especially with respect to making Bio331 an inclusive learning environment.  Let me know if anything makes you uncomfortable in class, if you would like more instruction on a topic, or if you are experiencing a hardship outside of class.  Anonymous feedback is available on Moodle, though with a small class your comments may be identifiable.
