# Course support

Bio131 has a number of support systems to help you in this class. Also see the [collaboration policy](collab.md).

## Student Hours

Student hours are times where I am in my office (Biology 200B) waiting for students to come talk with me. Drop in during these times to talk about anything (class related or otherwise), no appointment needed. Email me to set up an appointment if you cannot make student hour times.

## Teaching Assistants (TAs)

Each lab section will have a TA that will help you with the labs and any other in-lab work. They do not grade or do other course tasks -- their only goal is to help you with your work.

- Altaf Barelvi (he/him, Lewis & Clark '23) is a post-baccalaureate researcher here at Reed.
- Mei Tate (she/her, '25) is a junior CS major; she took Bio131 the last time it was offered.

## Tutoring (DoJo)

Tutoring is offered by Accademic Support Services, and gives students additional times outside of class to get help with assignments and the course material.

**Drop-In Tutoring:** Mei Tate will hold drop-in tutoring hours on Thursday evenings (XXX).

**One-on-One Tutoring.** Each student can get up to one hour per week _per class_ of individual tutoring. Mei is also available for one-on-one tutoring. If you cannot schedule a time with Mei or you need more support, please talk with me. You can sign up for individual tutoring on the [Reed tutoring app](https://iris.reed.edu/tutor/tutors/profiles)

## Academic Accommodations

Please discuss any documented accommodations with me, especially those that include extensions on assignments. Disability Accommodation Notification Letters can be obtained from [Disability & Accessibility Resources](https://www.reed.edu/disability-resources/).  All discussions will remain confidential.  

## Illness and Exceptional Circumstances

There may be cases where you cannot attend class for stretches at a time (due to illness, for example). In this case, email me to strategize a successful plan for learning the material. If you miss multiple classes and do not email me, I may reach out to make sure you are OK. 

In rare cases, there may be circumstances beyond your control where you are unable to meet the expectations outlined in this syllabus. Please email me as soon as you can to strategize a plan for completing all parts of the course. There are also ways for to take an emergency, short-term leave from the college - this is for exceptional circumstances, and it allows you to focus on _you_ and have the Student Life communicate with your teachers on your behalf. Reach out to careteam@reed.edu or Steve Abrah√£o, the Associate Dean of Students for Academic Life (sabrahao@reed.edu).

## Obligated Reporting

I am happy to talk with you about anything that concerns you, but note that I (and many faculty) are **obligated reporters**, who must report possible violations of the Title IX and/or DHSM policies, which govern discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, gender, and gender identity. Confidential resources are available at Health & Counseling Services and through the SHARE program; more information is availble on [this page](https://www.reed.edu/student-life/concerned/confidentiality-obligatory-reporting.html)
