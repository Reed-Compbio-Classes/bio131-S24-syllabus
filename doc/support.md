# Course support

Bio131 has a number of support systems to help you in this class. Also see the [collaboration policy](collab.md).

## Student Hours

Student hours are times where I am in my office (Biology 200B) waiting for students to come talk with me. Drop in during these times to talk about anything (class related or otherwise), no appointment needed. Email me to set up an appointment if you cannot make student hour times.

## Teaching Assistants (TAs)

Each lab section will have a TA that will help you with the labs and any other in-lab work. They do not grade or do other course tasks -- their only goal is to help you with your work.

- Altaf Barelvi (he/him, Lewis & Clark '23) is a post-baccalaureate researcher here at Reed.
- Mei Tate (she/her, '25) is a junior CS major; she took Bio131 the last time it was offered.

## Tutoring (DoJo)

Tutoring is offered by Accademic Support Services, and gives students additional times outside of class to get help with assignments and the course material.

**Drop-In Tutoring:** Mei Tate will hold drop-in tutoring hours on Thursday evenings (XXX).

**One-on-One Tutoring.** Each student can get up to one hour per week _per class_ of individual tutoring. Mei is also available for one-on-one tutoring. If you cannot schedule a time with Mei or you need more support, please talk with me. You can sign up for individual tutoring on the [Reed tutoring app](https://iris.reed.edu/tutor/tutors/profiles)
