# Course support

Bio131 has a number of support systems to help you in this class. 

## Student Hours: Tu 10-11 & Th 3-5, Biology 200B

Student hours are times where I am in my office (Biology 200B) waiting for students to come talk with me. Drop in during these times to talk about anything (class related or otherwise), no appointment needed. Email me to set up an appointment if you cannot make student hour times.

If many students cannot make these posted times, I may shift my student hours.

## Teaching Assistant (TA)

Altaf Barelvi (he/him, Lewis & Clark '23) is a post-baccalaureate researcher here at Reed. Altaf will be in the lab sections to will help you with the labs and any other in-lab work. He will not grade or do other course tasks -- Altaf's only goal is to help you with your work.

## Tutoring (DoJo)

Tutoring is offered by Accademic Support Services, and gives students additional times outside of class to get help with assignments and the course material. Each student can get up to one hour per week _per class_ of individual (one-on-one) tutoring.  _I am currently working to find tutors who will be available for one-on-one tutoring._ Once we have tutors in place, you can sign up for individual tutoring on the [Reed tutoring app](https://iris.reed.edu/tutor/tutors/profiles).

## Community Sessions

If students are interested, I will reserve a room in the Biology building for evening collaborative sessions to work on the assignments together. These sessions are in lieu of drop-in tutoring this year - I encourage you to do the work together because you can help each other out (especially if you get stuck) and programming together can be fun. 

## Academic Accommodations

Please discuss any documented accommodations with me. Disability Accommodation Notification Letters can be obtained from [Disability & Accessibility Resources](https://www.reed.edu/disability-resources/).  All discussions will remain confidential.  

## Illness and Exceptional Circumstances

There may be cases where you cannot attend class for stretches at a time (due to illness, for example). In this case, email me to strategize a successful plan for learning the material. If you miss multiple classes and do not email me, I may reach out to make sure you are OK. 

In rare cases, there may be circumstances beyond your control where you are unable to meet the expectations outlined in this syllabus. If there are extenuating circumstances that might impact your academic performance in this class, please inform me as soon as you can to strategize a plan for completing all parts of the course. Additionally, you may want to reach out to the [Student Life Office](https://www.reed.edu/student-life/) at student-life@reed.edu, phone: (503) 517-7396, office: Eliot 218. The Student Life Office is dedicated to assisting students in accessing campus and support resources, especially during challenging situations.

## Obligated Reporting

I am happy to talk with you about anything that concerns you, but note that I (and many faculty) are obligated reporters who must report possible violations of the [Title IX](https://www.reed.edu/governance/title-ix-policy/) and [DHSM](https://www.reed.edu/guidebook/comm_pol/dhsm_policy.html) policies which govern discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, gender, and gender identity. Confidential resources are available at Health & Counseling Services and through the SHARE program; more information is available on [this page](https://www.reed.edu/student-life/concerned/confidentiality-obligatory-reporting.html).
