# Course Policies

There are two policies for this course: one for [collaboration](#collaboration-policy) (which is encouraged for the programming assignments) and one for the use of [generative AI](#generative-ai-policy) (which is discouraged).

## Collaboration Policy

Computational biology is inherently a collaborative field, and there are many opportunities to work with and get help from different people within and outside of class. As an interdisciplinary course, doing work in Bio131 may lead to a few questions.  Who can you talk to? What resources can you use?  What does it mean to "cheat" while writing a program? This section describes available resources and what actions are in violation of the Honor Principle. Also see the [course support page](support.md).

1. You can ask **anyone** (Anna, tutors, other students) **anything** during lectures and labs.
2. You can **always** come to posted student hours or DoJo tutoring hours.
3. You can **always** look up how to use specific data types, syntax, and built-in functions we have learned in Python.

**Exams** will have an in-class, collaborative component and a take-home, individual component. You can work with other students on the in-class component, but you should do the take-home component on your own. Follow the instructions provided with the exam about what resources you can use during the exam.

Working together is encouraged for the **programming assignments.** You can talk to other students about the homework as much as you like, but you must write your own programs (even if you do it side-by-side). You need to "cite" who you work with - see below for more information.

You are encouraged to talk with others about the **book assignment**; the reflections should be your own writing.

#### Plagiarism when programming

Code plagiarism is a real thing.  Just like when writing papers, there is a way to cite others' work.  Identical code is just as bad as copying and pasting entire paragraphs of an essay from another source - **always write your code in your own style.**  You have a lot of flexibility in naming variables, including print statements and comments in your code.

1. The early programming assignments may have instructions to copy code exactly; in these examples, many students will have identical code, which is fine.  If you are uncertain about a homework, ask me.
2. For the larger programming assignments, your code may look similar to others if you work side by side.  If you have extensive discussions with me, tutors, or students, add their names as comments to the header of the file. For example,

```
 # Anna helped me begin problem 2
 # I discussed how to speed up problem 4 with Alex
 # I helped Jane out with problem 5.
```

Remember, this type of collaboration is expected and encouraged! People who worked together should list each other as collaborators, this will help us determine why some code might look similar.

### The Main Takeaway: Collaboration in class and on programming assignments is expected and encouraged! You should "cite" anyone you worked with on the programming assignments.

## Generative AI Policy

Generative AI is technology that is trained to generate text, images, or code from natural language prompts.  Two examples of generative AI that you might have seen before are ChatGPT (which returns text based on prompts) and GitHub Copilot (which returns code based on prompts).

The fact is, generative AI could do a pretty darn good job with some of the **programming assignments**. But the assignments are designed for _you_ to learn how to program in Python, and how to apply those skills to biological questions. Some of the things that are easy for generative AI to do -- for example, write some starter code for an assignment -- are extremely useful exercises for people who are learning to program. The [course goals](goals.md) of this class include learning how to implement computational biology solutions - if you use generative AI to do that, you are not demonstrating that you can do this on your own.

The same goes for using generative AI for solving **exam questions**. Generative AI might get some questions correct, but _you_ would not be demonstrating that you have learned the content. Don't worry - you will have opportunities to revise exams in order to demonstrate your learning.

Finally, generative AI will not do much good **writing reflections** based on the books, since the goal of the reflections is not necessarily the quality of the writing but a preparation for the in-lab discussion with your colleagues.

The goal of this class is to never make you feel like you just have to get the answer, no matter where it comes from. If you are feeling like this, then come talk with me and/or the tutors and we will strategize a way to help you learn the content without that pressure.

### The Main Takeaway: Generative AI should not be used in this class. But you should never feel the need to use it anyway.
