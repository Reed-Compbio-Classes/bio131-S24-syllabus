Some important changes regarding E1 & E2 and B1 & B2.

- Exams are now determined to be complete, partially complete, or missing based on the take-home portion. The in class component is now an optional opportunity for students to work together on a subset of the exam questions and get clarifying questions. See the [Biology and Computational Thinking](assessment/components.md#1-biology-and-computational-thinking) section for more details.

- There is now a clarification for the book reflections (B1 & B2) in the case that students cannot attend the in-lab discussion. In that case, after notifying Anna, students can complete both the writing prompt reflection and a longer reflection on the in-lab prompt. See the [Biology and Society](assessment/components.md#3-biology-and-society) section for more details.
