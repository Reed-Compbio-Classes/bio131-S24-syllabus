- **Remember the skills that you bring to the class.**  Everyone comes to Bio131 with a different set of knowledge and skills, and it might have nothing to do with biology or programming. Are you creative? Do you like to solve problems? Are you good at multitasking? Do you like to collaborate, or work independently? These (and many others) are examples of strengths you bring to Bio131.

- **Start the programming assignments early.** The time you spend on each assignment might vary drastically, depending on how much time you spend working through Python errors.
  - Have a plan for the work you need to do for each component of the assignment.
  - Work through problems on paper if you are confused with a concept.
  - After each step, no matter how small, check that your code still runs. Remember that if your code does not run due to an error it is considered "Missing" according to the [criteria](assessment/gradingcontract.md).
  - If you're stuck at _any point_ (trying to figure out what to do first, your code has errors you just can't figure out, the tests aren't passing and you can't figure out why), email me or come to student hours for help. 

- **This course is cumulative** -- topics build upon each other throughout the semester, and attendance is important (see the [attendance policy](policies.md#attendance-policy)).  Let me know if you miss a lecture or a lab to get caught up. There is no penalty for missing lecture or lab according to the grading contract, but the class is designed so that the in-class components help you complete the work outside of class.

- **Working collaboratively is fun!**  If possible, try to work with others on the assignments within the limits outlined in the [collaboration policy](policies.md/#collaboration-policy).

- **When in doubt, ask.** Asking for help is sometimes unintuitive, but a little clarification goes a long way.  
  - If you have the question, others will probably have the same question. Ask early so I can communicate the answers to the rest of the class.
  - Sometimes I make mistakes! Your question might help me fix a typo. 
  - If you have no idea how to start a problem (which happens!), stop by student hours or email me.
  - If you feel like you are falling behind and want to resort to copying material or using [generative AI](policies.md/#generative-ai-policy), come talk with me to get the support you need.

- **Start the assignments early.**  Really.
