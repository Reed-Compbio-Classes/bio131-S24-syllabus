- **Remember the skills that you bring to the class.**  Everyone comes to Bio131 with a different set of knowledge and skills, and it might have nothing to do with biology or programming. Are you creative? Do you like to solve problems? Are you good at multitasking? Do you like to collaborate, or work independently? These (and many others) are examples of strengths you bring to Bio131.
- **Start the programming assignments early.** The time you spend on each assignment might vary drastically, depending on how much you debug your programs.
 - Have a plan for the work you need to do for each component of the assignment.
 - Work through problems on paper if you are confused with a concept.
 - After each step, no matter how small, check that your code still runs.
 - If you're stuck, first make sure that your program runs without errors. This might mean carefully checking indentations, commenting pieces out, etc., until your code runs without errors, and then slowing putting pieces back in. Submitting code that runs but doesn't contain all the pieces is better than submitting code that doesn't run but "has all the parts."


- **This course is cumulative** -- topics build upon each other throughout the semester, and attendance is critical.  Let me know if you miss a lecture or a lab to get caught up. While there is no penalty for missing lecture, lab attendance is expected unless explicitly stated or accommodations have been arranged.  
- **Working collaboratively is fun!**  If possible, try to work with others on the assignments within the limits outlined in the [collaboration policy](collab.md)
- **When in doubt, ask.** Asking for help is sometimes unintuitive, but a little clarification goes a long way.  If you have no idea how to start a problem (which happens!), stop by office hours or the DoJo. Also take advantage of the one-on-one tutoring available. If you feel like you are falling behind and want to resort to copying material or using [generative AI](chatgpt.md), come talk with me to get the support you need.

- **Start the assignments early.**  Really.
