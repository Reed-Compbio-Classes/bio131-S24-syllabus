# Bio131: Introduction to Computational Biology

High-throughput technologies produce massive amounts of data, much too large to analyze by hand. The goal of this course is to learn how to analyze DNA, RNA, and protein sequences using computers. Through a combination of foundational examples and current research questions, this course aims to demystify computer science, molecular biology, and some of the ways they intersect.

## About this syllabus

This syllabus is a public, living document that contains all of the details for this iteration of the course. It is public because it is my goal to make every aspect of this class as transparent as possible. It is living because the course path and student interests may change; however consider this document to be a contract for the course.

The final version of this syllabus will be set by [XXX].  All modifications during the semester will be communicated to the class in a timely manner, and will be added in a "tracked-changes" style of writing.
