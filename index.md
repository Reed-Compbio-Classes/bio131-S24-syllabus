# Bio131: Introduction to Computational Biology

High-throughput technologies produce massive amounts of data, much too large to analyze by hand. The goal of this course is to learn how to analyze DNA, RNA, and protein sequences using computers. Through a combination of foundational examples and current research questions, this course aims to demystify computer science, molecular biology, and some of the ways they intersect.

## About this syllabus

This syllabus is a public, living document that contains all of the details for this iteration of the course. It is public because I want to make this class as transparent as possible. It is living because the course path and student interests may change. 

The final version of this syllabus will be set by Thursday, January 18.  Any modifications during the semester will be noted in the [Change Log](changelog.md) and will be communicated to the class via Moodle. We will discuss any major changes to the [assessment and grading contract](assessment/index.md) before this syllabus is altered.

## Course details

**Lecture:** MWF 10-10:50am in ETC 208

**Labs:** M 1:10-3:00 in ETC 211 and Tu 3:10-5:0 in ETC 208.

**Materials:**
- Textbook: Bioinformatics Algorithms by Pavel Pevzner and Philip Compeau. The chapters we will cover in class are [freely available online](Textbook is freely available online: https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/read-the-book).
- Book: you will choose between one of these two books within the first two weeks of class (both are available at the bookstore):
  - [The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation After the Genome](http://www.alondranelson.com/books/the-social-life-of-dna-race-reparations-and-reconciliation-after-the-genome) by Alondra Nelson
  - [Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/native-american-dna) by Kim TallBear
  

[Moodle](https://moodle.reed.edu/course/view.php?id=5287) will be the main form of communication in the class.
